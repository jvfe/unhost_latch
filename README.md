A Workflow for fastq preprocessing and host read removal

## UnHost

A FastQ preprocessing and host read removal workflow
for short-read metagenomics data. It's comprised of:

- [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) for read trimming, adapter removal and other preprocessing.

- [bowtie2](https://github.com/BenLangmead/bowtie2) for creating an index from the
  host's reference genome and extracting unaligned reads
  from an alignment to said genome.
